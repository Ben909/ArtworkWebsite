This steady flow of angular transitions makes the website less static and gives it an environment that is meant to relax the senses to the point of being comfortable. While it must be noted that not all users share the same experience, the goal was to practise and increase the overall aesthetic quality of the website."}),Object(u.jsx)("p",{children:"Upon revision of the idea to create an artwork within which the user creates their own unique set of colour gradients using the available tools, I have concluded that it is a task that cannot be undertaken, given my current technical competence to produce the necessary software which would enable it. I instead came across innovative ideas that were not only inspired by the work of fellow students, but by the power that comes with AI generated artworks and how easily accessible they are. For this reason, generative art has become the focus point in terms of the artistic piece which must be included with the React js Library. The website \u201cThis X does not exist\u201d contains stunning galleries based on various topics which generates new imagery each time the page is refreshed. I believe it will serve a role in tying the theoretical frameworks introduced in the course as well as emphasize the vision of my website as an artistic piece."}),Object(u.jsx)("p",{children:" On a more critical note, I think my website falls short in many areas to exemplify and deliver the qualities that would otherwise help it to stand out. Additional work is required throughout every section to tie the website together as a whole. The header for example, should visually indicate to the user which tab they currently have selected.
