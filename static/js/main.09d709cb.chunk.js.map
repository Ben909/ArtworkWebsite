introduced in the \r\n                            interactive media 4 course. A selection of blog posts is available to offer feedback and reflect on the most important technical and creative components of the \r\n                            website. Towards the end, the website aims to achieve creative and systematic coherence in all aspects of its design to display critical engagement with the \r\n                            course and allow it to be considered a creative piece in itself. In future development and upcoming assessments, new artistic components will be introduced using the \r\n                            React library to meaningfully tie the website together as a whole. The current experimental artwork provides a simple overview for the artistic direction of the website. The \r\n                            sample below illustrates the current artistic direction of the website and artworks planned for future implementation. These artworks will use transformative gradients \r\n                            to create mesmerizing effects for the user to experience.\r\n                        </p>\r\n

focusses on art creation which takes form from the visual effects created by gradation. The technique uses a spectrum of colour volumes, space and \r\n                atmosphere to illustrate gradual transitions of one or more colours to another set of colour hues. The tools to create these effects are extremely powerful and \r\n                versatile when it comes to methods of manipulating properties such as blending or shading. The creation and dissemination of these artworks shares knowledge about \r\n                the theories discussed in ‘The Work of Art in the Age of the Internet’. The unique aura that is now replaced and embodied by its reproductions will be highlighted \r\n                in terms of how modern tools are used to create a completely unique feel to designs. A Combination of subtle and bold designs will be used as a focal point to \r\n                express depth to an otherwise flat design. The use gradients with any other artwork creates endless possibilities to the emphasize colours, textures and shapes \r\n                of the original artwork. This exposes audiences to alternative modern art that feels fresh or possibly visually overwhelming. </p>\r\n        \r\n                <div class=\"contain2\">\r\n                    <div class=\"art2\"></div>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n                <h1 class=\"titlemid\">Updated Artwork Proposal</h1>\r\n\r\n            <p>As mentioned in the technical reflection blog post, the artwork proposal has changed considerably since its first iteration. It has changed from being a customizable \r\n                colour gradient selector due to the technical difficulty of implementing such an interface. The current version of the proposed artwork is focused more on the ability \r\n                of AI and the internet to create generative artworks. This proposal maintains the vision of the website and the theoretical frameworks discussed in the blog section. \r\n                The use of AI generated artworks emphasises a few important notions raised in the work of art in the age of the internet as well as code criticality and literacy. This \r\n                proposal invites users to experience and judge the effects of artworks which are created by computer AI. It offers a newfound perspective about the creation of art whose \r\n                artist does not even exist. The artwork is also temporary and can never be viewed again once the webpage is refreshed. This makes for a unique experience between the user \r\n                and the few moments they have to appreciate data driven artworks. </p>\r\n                <Art/>\r\n\r\n                <h1 class=\"titlemid\">Exam Artwork rationale and reflection</h1>\r\n\r\n            <p>My final internet artwork displays a randomly generated AI Artwork using a website link known as thisxdoesnotexist.com. I decided to create this kind of artwork because it\r\n                it illustrates the power of art on the internet through how technology can be used to effortlessly image that has no true origin or creator. This artwork is also exemplifies \r\n                some of the theories discussed in blog posts like ‘art in the age of the internet’ as well as the reproductive qualities of internet artworks.    </p>    \r\n\r\n            <p>The also chose this type of internet artwork since it is slightly more appealing than my previous proposal which would only generate color gradients based on the users input. \r\n                These Ai artworks might only be viewed for a moment; however, I came to the realization that once it disappears, it will be gone forever. This gives the user only a brief \r\n                opportunity to see and experience something as if it were only once in a lifetime. The power of such technologies cannot go unappreciated. Any of the displayed images can \r\n                also be saved and copied, should the user intend to do so. Images like these might even be claimed and used by people without any strict terms or conditions, which opens \r\n                the door to many other opportunities. This just goes to show how endless the possibilities sometimes are when it when advanced technologies are made easy to use.</p> \r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n    </article> \r\n\r\n</main>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/wireframe-min.593717b6.png\";","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\nimport \"../styles/Wireframe.css\";\r\nimport First from '../images/wireframe-min.png';\r\nimport Second from '../images/Palette-min.png';\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default class Contact extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <main>\r\n                <article className=\"centre\">\r\n\r\n                    <h1 className=\"titlemid\">Website Reflection</h1>\r\n\r\n                    <p>Initially I created wireframes to get an idea for layout of various sections throughout the website. This has helped me to allocate space and margins more \r\n                    effectively and to improve aesthetics. In its current state, the website presents the overall idea of an artistic piece but lacks elements and characteristics \r\n                    which exemplifies and communicates the integration of artworks with the site as a whole. The future development of this website will be more focused on illustrating\r\n                    interactive artworks that is also inspired by the theoretical framework of the course. The goal is to create a unique experience for the user and have them feel \r\n                    satisfied with the environment established by the website. For the colour palette of the website, I decided to use a variety of light brown to orange colours which \r\n                    creates a relaxing overall tone for the website. The colours are also inspired by the vision of the website, which represents a digital canvas as a medium to \r\n                    express artworks. My idea was to give the website an older appearance while still using modern technology to create artworks. This helps the website to be aligned \r\n                    with the theories discussed in “The Work of Art in the Age of the Internet’’.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n

The aim of decolonisation is to undo \r\n                        mentalities that permeate government, education and media policies to purposefully regenerate native knowledge, epistemologies and ways of life (Keet, 2014). \r\n                        History recognizes that Western ideologies or the Global North holds superiority over Southern powers concerning the development, production and dissemination of \r\n                        knowledge. \r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p> Mbembe (2015) exemplifies how the process of ‘demythologizing whiteness’ in universities restructures and reconciles the accumulation of knowledge, creativity \r\n                        and the free will of individuals to perform within educational frameworks. Based on contextual evidence of the Cecil Rhodes statue, the practise of newly formulated \r\n                        educational frameworks raises issues which relates to the disregard of original traditions and thoughts that created a functional system in the first place. Balance \r\n                        is therefore crucial and offers the key to justify implementing strategies of decolonising knowledge.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p> The representation of politics in geo-political locations offer divisions between belonging to a nation fortified through the creation of a ‘nation-state’ and the \r\n                        laws that govern the reproduction of knowledge. This refers to how the ‘colonized’ translates historical discourse and the legitimization of Western and European \r\n                        thoughts and research practises. The decolonisation of knowledge seeks to eradicate these assumptions through the addition of new means and approaches to legitimize \r\n                        knowledge. Mignolo emphasizes that the philosophy of decolonisation should encourage the addition of knowledge frameworks rather than removing the epistemic privilege \r\n                        of the First World (Mignolo, 2009). Thereby we extend and repurpose that knowledge with the goal to gain more insight about it. We conduct research and measure outcomes \r\n                        through the accumulation of information and data that is available to us. In terms of research output, science, mathematics and biology are perceived as the most legitimate \r\n                        forms of knowledge in contemporary society because they aim to find universal laws and absolute truths that apply in all circumstances.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p> The way we operate in these research fields often provides an historical, value free and objective understanding of society. Psychological research in neuroscience \r\n                        for example, looks at differences in brain types of men and woman and how those types of ideas are reproduced and translated into different hierarchies which are \r\n                        imbedded in society. It is important to challenge this idea of knowledge and to extend our own perspectives surrounding the development of new theories and approaches \r\n                        on how knowledge is attained. \r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p> Within technology lies the power and the will to construct complex ideologies which reinforces certain cultural values and beliefs. These digital philosophies \r\n                        often blur the lines of truth for the sake of other goals which leads to the spread of misguided information and the misrepresentation of certain social structures. \r\n                        For example, games have a significant influence on the minds of players, both in young and old to associate serious topics such as criminality and violence with the \r\n                        behaviour of certain cultural groups. This translation reveals the identities of stereotyped groups through how games communicate as a medium. While this may not be \r\n                        the intended purpose of the game, it is the medium and provided technology that emphasizes and constructs these narratives into reality. \r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <aside className=\"reference\">\r\n                        <p><strong>References</strong><br></br>Keet, A.

This internet \r\n                        artwork confirms the transformation and move away from art as having a distinct aura to now being the subject of reproduction. The way visual artworks are constructed, \r\n                        viewed and understood have been altered in unique ways to suit this transformation. It is more so the reproduction of artworks that is favoured by the display system, \r\n                        than the unique artefact itself. “The reproduction no longer serves its traditional function as a stand-in for the original artwork, whose aura evinced a desire to be \r\n                        experienced in the flesh” (Carrier, 2020). The possibility for an artwork to reach a high number of viewers eclipses the desire to view the source of a reproduction.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p> A review of the technological advancements over the last few decades makes it evident that internet art is an ever-changing phenomenon. It adapts in relation to the \r\n                        development of software technologies and the capacity available for artists to express their work. Modern techniques, tools and materials which facilitate the making \r\n                        of an artistic object have changed with the advent of technology to create new possibilities for the production, consumption and dissemination of artworks. Unlike \r\n                        timeless renowned artists, most of today’s artists have embraced technology as a means to monetize and create their art. In 2018 the online art market was valued \r\n                        at 4.64 bilion US dollars and it is estimated that by 2024 the world wide internet art market will be worth 9.32 bilion US dollars (ValueWalk, 2021).\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p> It is evident how the age of social media and the internet has not only changed our definition of art but also how we interact with it. We approach and explore the \r\n                        qualities of internet artworks through the change in its medium that is brought to us by the development of the internet. Online support and social media platforms \r\n                        offer their own opportunities to present a new artistic landscape for us all. The result of this shift in artistic practise redefines and interrogates the process art \r\n                        analysis. This poses various questions such as, what is the overall message of the artwork? What does the artist want the viewer to notice? What is the theme of the \r\n                        artwork? The answers, although few and far between, can be narrowed down to depicting the global phenomenon and the peculiarities of the period and environment and \r\n                        events which surround the artist.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p> Internet artworks draw on data from other internet materials and websites, which helps give them their distinctive dynamics and transience. Such is the case in the \r\n                        artwork The Wrong – Pavilion Poster, which presents elusive and sometimes anarchic art which uses the internet as its primary material. Through this art, the \r\n                        relationship between image and idea demonstrates the conceptual experience of reality. It uses the more or less abstract signs to contribute to the illustration of a \r\n                        concept. To this end, the artwork uses visual language to describe a reality and at the same time, communicate the rise of free artistic expression.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <aside className=\"reference\">\r\n                        <p><strong>References</strong><br></br>Carrier, D.

The aim is to record the development of the site \r\n                        and how future reflections will show additional improvements to the already existing content. In its early development, the website only contained the most important\r\n                        elements that were required to structure various sections and information.   \r\n                    </p>  \r\n\r\n                    <p> This includes a home page to help contextualize what the site it about by introducing topics that the user can expect to find throughout the site. A blog section was \r\n                        created as a holding place for discussions about theoretical engagement and reflective work. The internet art page focusses on developing and implementing artworks \r\n                        as outlined in the assignment brief. It will be used to experiment with ideas about internet art and detail the processes that created them. It is important that \r\n                        this section ties the site together as a whole to communicate the artistic intension of the website to the user. The final wireframe section gives a clear indication \r\n                        of the websites conceptual structure, the layout of sections, interactive elements and how they are presented.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p> Considerations about the spacing between various elements was a crucial endeavour. This is important for the overall readability of content and to prevent the user \r\n                        from feeling overwhelmed by cluttered information. This was achieved by creating a grid layout for the blog section, which helped to distribute space more equally \r\n                        in the centre of the webpage and elevate the overall aesthetic of the site. The display of text and other core content is positioned in the middle of each page \r\n                        which is designed to direct the readers focus and give a steady flow of information without causing discomfort in the readers eyes. \r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p> The website has a slight performance issue when it comes to loading images on the blog and wireframe page. To counteract this for the time being, every image on \r\n                        the website was compressed and given a lower quality resolution to reduce file sizes. This helped the website load content slightly quicker, but further iteration \r\n                        is be necessary. Another technical challenge involves the sites compatibility with responsive design. This is due to a technical fault where the header section does \r\n                        not work properly with the main tabs section. This can be fixed by individually reworking the main text element in the CSS file or looking at an alternative way merge \r\n                        both sections.         \r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <section className=\"next\">\r\n                        <Link to=\"/post2\">\r\n                        <button><strong>Previous Blog</strong></button>\r\n                        </Link>\r\n\r\n                        <Link to=\"/blogs\">\r\n                        <button><strong>View Blogs</strong></button>\r\n                        </Link>\r\n\r\n                        <Link to=\"/post4\">\r\n                        <button><strong>Next Blog</strong></button>\r\n                        </Link>\r\n                    </section>\r\n\r\n                </article>\r\n            </main>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\nimport \"../styles/posts.css\";\r\n\r\nexport default class post4 extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <main>\r\n                <article className=\"centreblog\">\r\n\r\n                <h1>Artistic Reflection and Creative Process</h1>\r\n\r\n                    <p> This reflection document will detail the creative elements of the website and how they serve to express the artistic components which form an integral part of the \r\n                        interactive media 4 course. The artistic process further aims to illustrate the vision of artworks in relation to the theoretical frameworks and the website as a whole.\r\n                    </p>    \r\n\r\n                    <p> The artistic inspiration for the layout and colours of this website comes from roots of art creation. A variety of limestone colours were selected to theme and style \r\n                        the website so that it resembles a type of transformative digital canvas. This was done by experimenting and generating a colour palette from a combination of \r\n                        limestone rocks and old canvases found online. Colour gradients were added to three sections on the website to make it look more authentic and aligned with my \r\n                        vision of an internet artwork. I furthered the design with a light on dark colour palette to create a contrasting effect between the background and the actual \r\n                        content of each page on the site. This helped to put an emphasis on important information for the user to engage with as well as situate ways in which the website \r\n                        can be viewed as an artistic piece. \r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p> The slow transition from one colour gradient to another has a subtle yet noticeable effect on the users’ senses and experience. This was achieved by implementing a \r\n                        repeating-background animation which takes various colour combinations into effect. It is vital that this effect does not to put strain on the eyes of users. \r\n                        Therefore, the colour selection and animation speed are key to achieving the desired aesthetic effect. To many bright and contrasting colours creates an off-putting \r\n                        effect, while fast animations or transitions makes it harder to focus on and read text. This was revealed after much experimentation with gradients and transitions. \r\n                        The final result uses a combination of light brown, black and orange limestone colours which slowly transitions to create a delicate and soothing effect while the user \r\n                        navigates through the website.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p> While each content page remains static for the purpose of user readability, the background and header sections are designed in relation with the vision of \r\n                        transformative internet art. The planned artworks for the future of this website will have transformative elements that intends to suit the site as a whole. The goal \r\n                        is to achieve artistic coherence throughout every part of the website to emphasize how it stands as artwork.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <section className=\"next\">\r\n                        <Link to=\"/post3\">\r\n                        <button><strong>Previous Blog</strong></button>\r\n                        </Link>\r\n\r\n                        <Link to=\"/blogs\">\r\n                        <button><strong>View Blogs</strong></button>\r\n                        </Link>\r\n\r\n                        <Link to=\"/post5\">\r\n                        <button><strong>Next Blog</strong></button>\r\n                        </Link>\r\n                    </section>\r\n\r\n                </article>\r\n            </main>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\nimport \"../styles/posts.css\";\r\n\r\nexport default class post5 extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <main>\r\n                <article className=\"centreblog\">\r\n\r\n                <h1>Code Literacy and Criticality</h1>\r\n\r\n                    <p> A simple Google search for the words ‘criticality’ and ‘literacy’ returns the definition of being able to read and write crucial information as underlined by \r\n                        specific ideological beliefs and social factors. This relationship has existed in the world of programming since the first computers were developed. As such, \r\n                        literacy in terms of computers emphasizes ‘’the importance, flexibility and power of writing for and with computers’’ (Vee, 2013). The popularity of programming \r\n                        hardly needs introduction, however, there is a need to introduce a dialogue about the reasons for its popularity and importance throughout history and in the 21st \r\n                        century as exemplified by Annette Vee. \r\n                    </p>    \r\n\r\n                    <p> The rise of programming literacy has revealed the connectedness of code and computers in our daily lives. Its affordances as a powerful mode of communication are \r\n                        extended by the relationship between computational and textual literacy. Vee argues that ‘’the refrain of literacy in reference to computer programming is not only \r\n                        apt because of these parallels, but that our definition of literacy must shift to accommodate this new form of digital writing’’ (Vee,2013). The technology of code, \r\n                        much like textual literacy, is facilitated by humans through computer programming to allow developers to represent, express and interpret ideas digitally. \r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p> While computers represent these super sophisticated pieces of technology, their main functionality comes from how we manipulate them to serve our needs. They \r\n                        communicate and complete tasks using a numerical language or machine code known as binary that is designed to carry out instructions based on how the computer \r\n                        interprets a series of 1’s and 0’s. Each written program is composed of millions upon millions of 1’s and 0’s that makes it a difficult language to understand. \r\n                        This is where programming comes in handy, which translates our English instructions into Binary code. ‘Procedural literacy’ according to Vee involves the potential \r\n                        to reconstruct rules and concepts to understand procedures not solely on computers, but in general (Vee, 2013: 46) . This is how programming languages have \r\n                        fundamentally become extremely useful tools as the middleman for translating any program into machine code. These languages vary in how powerful they are, depending on \r\n                        a variety of computational tasks, for example constructing a moving robot proposes more specific technical and mechanical requirements than developing a website.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p> In the 21st century, the importance of teaching programming in the classroom is underscored by the specialized domain of computer science and how it flows into other \r\n                        specialized fields. The scope of computer literacy moves well beyond any conceived boundary that seeks to gauge or limit its functions in the world. This \r\n                        literacy changes as new inscription technologies are added to computers.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <aside className=\"reference\">\r\n                        <p><strong>References</strong><br></br>Vee, A.

The digital divide reflects the gap in internet and technology access\r\n                        that prohibits people from participating in vital parts of society. This led to economic and social inequality which has an impact on the spread of information and \r\n                        communication technologies. It is historically recognized that the integration of digitalization seeks to rectify the imbalance caused by the inability of low \r\n                        socio-economic groups to be granted access to technology and its affordances. This is not helped by the manner in which Covid-19 has influenced the lives and opportunities \r\n                        of individuals globally. “More than 1.5 billion students have been affected by school closures due to the Covid-19 pandemic” (Tataki & Glynos, 2020). As a result, the \r\n                        most suitable and perhaps only solution for students to continue their academic curriculum came in the form of e-learning. This disruption has caused major disparities \r\n                        in how educational resources are allocated and communicated to students who are expected to fulfil specific assessment standards. \r\n                    </p>    \r\n\r\n                    <p> The pandemic has changed our awareness of the digital divide. This issue is emphasized through the fact that Covid-19 has widened the gap between those that have access to \r\n                        modern technology versus those that do not. In a society where we are increasingly defined by our access to information, many are excluded and left in the digital dark age \r\n                        because they are technologically illiterate or simply cannot afford to access internet services. According to The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \r\n                        Organization (UNESCO), 40% of students are unable to access the internet from home and only 50% of students have access to a computer while the other 830 million are left \r\n                        disadvantaged with only a few possible solutions (Tataki & Glynos, 2020). These include making the internet accessible to places it’s never been before, and making the \r\n                        service more accessible where it already exists. \r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p> With much of daily life moved online, the coronavirus pandemic dramatically exposed the digital divide and our continuous struggle to overcome it. While there are global \r\n                        containment strategies to prevent further spreading of the virus, these should under no circumstances leave members of marginalized communities vulnerable. This is because\r\n                        neglect leaves these communities further seperated from bridging the digital divide while strategies to provide assistance is often overshadowed by the sheer scale of the gap \r\n                        that already exists between communities.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p> Amidst the pandemic, academic institutions face the challenges of transitioning to an unfamiliar online teaching environment. While the adaption to these new circumstances \r\n                        might hinder the quality of education, teachers maintain their integrity to accommodate students who are vulnerable to unforeseen events such as the stability and \r\n                        availability of technology in an online teaching space. Many strategies have been put in place to ensure students are given the best opportunities to succeed. According \r\n                        to Correia (2020), clarity and open communication between instructors and learners are essential to ensure the success of support strategies such as access to free \r\n                        resources and tools. The use of non-data related technologies is also encouraged since the majority has limited bandwidth and data as their disposal. While Covid invades \r\n                        nearly every aspect of our world, it has forced us to reappropriate our response to the ever-present technological barrier of the digital divide.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <aside className=\"reference\">\r\n                        <p><strong>References</strong><br></br>Correia, A.P.

It is a visual interface that critiques commercial browsers for their \r\n                        passive and limited modes of web browsing. The radial interface visualizes the act of browsing as an engagement with the structure of the web, thereby removing all \r\n                        images and text formats and instead allowing users to move freely and view the interconnectedness of texts. As such, we as the observer become immersed in the network \r\n                        that maintains the structure of the internet. The artwork embraces that which exists both ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ the internet. Chatel maintains, “The main difference \r\n                        thus lies in the position of the artist himself which in the later form not only witness acts but also engages with the web just as any other participant would” \r\n                        (Chatel, 2019). This offers a provocation for net artists to establish and view their work beyond the elements of HTML and to consider the engagement software possesses \r\n                        as a key to the underside of the web.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p> In the 4th iteration of Web Stalker, the goal was to present an interface that allow users to access the qualities of networks embedded within additional software. \r\n                        “We wanted to develop an approach that would privilege fast access to information, and the ability to look ahead of the structures that were presented to users as \r\n                        well as to map the idiomatic structures of sites” (Fuller, 2017). The artwork proposes a vision that channels the content of websites and how browsers interpret \r\n                        mark-up language. It then repurposed the data to display the network of links embedded within it. This creates new aesthetics that visualizes websites in their \r\n                        own unique way. Every link draws a line which connects to URLs in the form of circles to create a map which spreads out in every direction. \r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p> This rhizomatic structure draws attention to the phrase referred to by Chatel as ‘New Aesthetics’, where the focus of artwork shifts from being an object to instead \r\n                        emphasize the underlying systems of artistic production. The Web Stalker artwork intends to use technical intervention to refine the aesthetic qualities provided \r\n                        by the internet as a space for creative inventions. It analyses websites through their links to contribute to the development of software as a means to elicit \r\n                        innovation which is driven by social and cultural forces. The Web Stalker artwork treats the internet as a space for reinvention. But what value lies in the \r\n                        ‘The Web Stalker’ artwork when it is designed as an anti-browser software? Not only does it visualize entire websites as a single interconnected entity, but each \r\n                        artefact also explores the designer’s intention throughout the document in a unique and meaningful way. \r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <aside className=\"reference\">\r\n                        <p><strong>References</strong><br></br>Chatel, M.

This reflection will detail step by step how I assembled \r\n                        the components necessary to construct the current version of the proposed artwork. First, I will highlight the most important challenges and instances where I failed \r\n                        while working on this section of the assignment.\r\n                    </p>    \r\n\r\n                    <p> My initial idea to create artworks from a combination of linear and radial colour gradients was quickly expunged when I began working with React. This is mainly due to \r\n                        the fact that I underestimated its steep learning curve and how it utilizes tools to create the vital components that were needed for my artwork project. I succeeded in \r\n                        an exercise to create a button which gradually changes the background colour within a section of the webpage. However, this was a long way off creating an interface that \r\n                        took multiple colours, as selected by the user, to then produce a background gradient that is either radial or linear. This challenged me to understand the integration \r\n                        and function of external dependencies like Multilingual User Interface, which was needed to create multiple grids and overlaying pop-up cards. I decided to discard this \r\n                        idea of an internet artwork and though of simpler methods that were more practical and would still suit my website. \r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p> In the next attempt, I started with what will be the final React internet artwork. While considering alternative methods to produce an artwork, the website ‘This X does \r\n                        not exist’ provided a practical solution to create artworks that aren’t real in the sense that they weren’t created by someone who is real. Using AI to produce generative \r\n                        artworks, it only became a question of accessing the source of the websites image gallery and linking it to my React application. On the next step, I created a component \r\n                        which draws an image onto a canvas and by importing useRef and useState, React is able to determine when to change a designated image file. With every reload of the browser \r\n                        page, a newly generated artwork will appear in the canvas. A rectangle was added as a border to fill every new image that is loaded.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p> While this is the current state of my React artwork, I’ve yet to successfully establish the proper routing to connect the website and publish it on Github. Regardless, \r\n                        the fault is mine but it is in my own best interest to showcase this area of work through the display of images below, although this does not \r\n                        excuse the fact that the React library is not embedded in my source code. As such, I accept the incurred penalties. \r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <section className=\"artprev\">\r\n                        <img className=\"wire\" src={Picone} alt=\"pic\"/>\r\n                        <img className=\"wire\" src={Pictwo} alt=\"pic\"/>\r\n                    </section>\r\n\r\n\r\n                    <section className=\"next\">\r\n                        <Link to=\"/post7\">\r\n                        <button><strong>Previous Blog</strong></button>\r\n                        </Link>\r\n\r\n                        <Link to=\"/blogs\">\r\n                        <button><strong>View Blogs</strong></button>\r\n                        </Link>\r\n\r\n                        <Link to=\"/post9\">\r\n                        <button><strong>Next Blog</strong></button>\r\n                        </Link>\r\n                    </section>\r\n\r\n                </article>\r\n            </main>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\nimport \"../styles/posts.css\";\r\n\r\nexport default class post9 extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <main>\r\n                <article className=\"centreblog\">\r\n\r\n                <h1>Artistic Reflection 2</h1>\r\n\r\n                <p> The most recent changes and additions that were added to the website has caused a slight shift in the vision of the website and how it seeks to communicate these \r\n                    changes through its content.

This steady flow of angular transitions makes \r\n                    the website less static and gives it an environment that is meant to relax the senses to the point of being comfortable. While it must be noted that not all users \r\n                    share the same experience, the goal was to practise and increase the overall aesthetic quality of the website.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p >Upon revision of the idea to create an artwork within which the user creates their own unique set of colour gradients using the available tools, I have concluded \r\n                    that it is a task that cannot be undertaken, given my current technical competence to produce the necessary software which would enable it. I instead came across \r\n                    innovative ideas that were not only inspired by the work of fellow students, but by the power that comes with AI generated artworks and how easily accessible they \r\n                    are. For this reason, generative art has become the focus point in terms of the artistic piece which must be included with the React js Library. The website “This X \r\n                    does not exist” contains stunning galleries based on various topics which generates new imagery each time the page is refreshed. I believe it will serve a role in \r\n                    tying the theoretical frameworks introduced in the course as well as emphasize the vision of my website as an artistic piece.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p> On a more critical note, I think my website falls short in many areas to exemplify and deliver the qualities that would otherwise help it to stand out. Additional \r\n                    work is required throughout every section to tie the website together as a whole. The header for example, should visually indicate to the user which tab they currently \r\n                    have selected. Every detail lends itself to the entire integration of the website. Towards the final submission, each element must interact and meaningfully communicate \r\n                    the intention of myself as designer of the website.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                    <section className=\"next\">\r\n                        <Link to=\"/post8\">\r\n                        <button><strong>Previous Blog</strong></button>\r\n                        </Link>\r\n\r\n                        <Link to=\"/blogs\">\r\n                        <button><strong>View Blogs</strong></button>\r\n                        </Link>\r\n\r\n                        <Link to=\"/post10\">\r\n                        <button><strong>Next Blog</strong></button>\r\n                        </Link>\r\n                    </section>\r\n\r\n                </article>\r\n            </main>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\nimport \"../styles/posts.css\";\r\n\r\nexport default class post9 extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <main>\r\n                <article className=\"centreblog\">\r\n\r\n                <h1>Technical Reflection 3</h1>\r\n\r\n                <p> This technical reflection discusses the final development and processes that were implemented for this website. The use of the React library has been one major \r\n                    addition to the project since the previous assignment. I will discuss the challenges that I’ve encountered and reflect on the failures and successes that has led \r\n                    to the current state of the website.\r\n                </p>    \r\n\r\n                <p> At first, the learning curve associated with React was intimidating yet simple in term of how components are created, imported and reused throughout the website. \r\n                    The challenge comes in the way React uses routing and links between different pages, and getting used to going back and forth between files to ensure everything is \r\n                    imported and used correctly. I succeeded in creating the navigation and establishing the appropriate routing between each main section of the website. I then proceeded to scaffold the contents \r\n                    of each page by assigning all the necessary resources to specific folders based on the work that was had done in assignment 1 and 2.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p >When deploying to Github, I encountered an issue where the browser displays an error 404 message ‘this page cannot be reached’ whenever I attempt to reload a page. This\r\n                    was a major problem since my internet artwork depends on the user reloading the webpage in order to display a new AI generated artwork.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p> While looking for possible solutions I found that this issue occurs because react router is used to move between the pages of my application. This mechanism is called \r\n                    client side routing and it is not supported by every server which Github is included. Since I couldn’t fix this problem my internet artwork has been left in a difunctional \r\n                    state which required the user to re-view the Github deployment and navigate to the Artworks section to notice the effect. The index or homepage also does not display any \r\n                    content and requires the user to select ‘Home’ from the navigation bar to be able to see the actual homepage content.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                    <section className=\"next\">\r\n                        <Link to=\"/post9\">\r\n                        <button><strong>Previous Blog</strong></button>\r\n                        </Link>\r\n\r\n                        <Link to=\"/blogs\">\r\n                        <button><strong>View Blogs</strong></button>\r\n                        </Link>\r\n\r\n                    </section>\r\n\r\n                </article>\r\n            </main>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n","import './App.css';\nimport Navbar from './components/Navbar';\nimport { Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport Home from './pages/Home';\nimport Footer from './components/Footer';\nimport Blogs from './pages/Blogs';\nimport Artworks from './pages/Artworks';\nimport Wireframes from './pages/Wireframes';\n\nimport Post1 from './pages/post1';\nimport Post2 from './pages/post2';\nimport Post3 from './pages/post3';\nimport Post4 from './pages/post4';\nimport Post5 from './pages/post5';\nimport Post6 from './pages/post6';\nimport Post7 from './pages/post7';\nimport Post8 from './pages/post8';\nimport Post9 from './pages/post9';\nimport Post10 from './pages/post10';\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n        <Navbar/>\n        <Routes>\n            <Route exact path='/' element={<Home/>}/>\n            <Route export path='/blogs' element={<Blogs/>}/>\n            <Route export path='/artworks' element={<Artworks/>}/>\n            <Route export path='/wireframes' element={<Wireframes/>}/>\n\n            <Route export path='/post1' element={<Post1/>}/>\n            <Route export path='/post2' element={<Post2/>}/>\n            <Route export path='/post3' element={<Post3/>}/>\n            <Route export path='/post4' element={<Post4/>}/>\n            <Route export path='/post5' element={<Post5/>}/>\n            <Route export path='/post6' element={<Post6/>}/>\n            <Route export path='/post7' element={<Post7/>}/>\n            <Route export path='/post8' element={<Post8/>}/>\n            <Route export path='/post9' element={<Post9/>}/>\n            <Route export path='/post10' element={<Post10/>}/>\n\n        </Routes>\n        <Footer/>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\nimport {BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <BrowserRouter>\n    <App />\n    </BrowserRouter>\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
